## 👤 About the Maintainer

PESiMENs is built and maintained by **Darshan P Pawar**, a solo developer who built the platform from scratch. The private repository contains **~400 commits** covering product, frontend, backend, and infrastructure work.

**Scope delivered:**

- 30+ database tables across ~90 SQL migrations
- 31 backend route modules with production-ready APIs
- Integrations with Supabase, Razorpay, OneSignal, Gemini, Groq, Adzuna, and PESU Academy sync

## 🏗 Architecture

PESiMENs uses a monorepo with a React frontend, a Fastify backend API, and a Python sync service. The frontend communicates with the backend over REST APIs, and the backend integrates with Supabase and external providers. Specific internal modules, routes, and operational details are kept private.

- `backend/` Backend configuration placeholder (core code is private)
- `docs/` Public documentation
- `App_logos/` Brand assets

## 🚀 Getting Started (Frontend)

This public repo ships the frontend UI. The backend and production services are private, so some features require mocked data or the live API.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Install and run

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Environment setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

If you have access to the live API, set `VITE_API_URL` accordingly.

## ✅ Security Snapshot

This section gives a quick public summary of the platform’s security posture.

| Area | Summary |
|------|---------|
| **Authentication** | Sensitive session handling is protected and not documented with internal implementation detail. |
| **Secrets** | No real passwords, tokens, or service credentials are stored in this repo. |
| **Validation** | User input is validated before it reaches protected app flows. |
| **Browser Safety** | Security headers, origin controls, and CSRF protections are used where relevant. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Abuse-prone features are limited to reduce spam and automated misuse. |
| **Content Safety** | Moderation and admin review protect user-generated content surfaces. |
| **AI Safety** | Athena AI uses managed backend providers and is protected from direct secret exposure. |
| **Payments** | Payment-related configuration stays outside the public repo. |

### Security Principles

- Keep sensitive values in environment variables or a secret manager.
- Treat authentication, payments, and AI provider access as private operational concerns.
- Avoid committing uploads, logs, and generated data.
- Use moderation and audit trails for user-facing content and admin actions.

---

## 🔒 Security

Security is a core part of the product design. The public repo describes the controls at a high level without exposing implementation secrets.

### Authentication & Session Security

- Authentication is separated from the public documentation and handled by the live application.
- The platform supports secure sign-in via PESU Academy credentials, Google Auth, and passwordless magic links.
- User sessions use short-lived access behavior and longer-lived refresh behavior to reduce token exposure.
- Token rotation and revocation are used to limit reuse of compromised sessions.
- Sensitive login flows are treated as protected operations and are not documented with step-by-step exploit detail.

### Data Protection

- Sensitive credentials are not stored in the public repo.
- Example environment files contain placeholders only.
- Secret values are injected through deployment-time environment variables or a secret manager.
- Production data, service keys, JWT signing values, and payment secrets are never meant to be published here.

### Application Security

- Input validation is used to reduce injection and malformed-request risk.
- Security headers and origin controls are used to limit browser-based abuse.
- CSRF protections are used for state-changing browser requests.
- Rate limiting helps reduce abuse of login, AI, messaging, and code-execution features.
- Moderation and approval flows are used for user-generated content that can affect other users.

### AI Security

- Athena AI uses Gemini and Groq as backend providers.
- AI requests are controlled through validation and abuse-prevention measures.
- Model access is treated as a managed service, not a public client-side secret.
- The public repo should not reveal provider keys, routing details, or internal prompt logic.

### Payments & Marketplace Safety

- Payment-related values are handled outside the public repo.
- Marketplace, mentoring, and purchase flows are treated as sensitive business logic.
- Public documentation should describe the existence of these features, not reveal internal processing details.

### Abuse Prevention

- Content moderation is used for user submissions.
- Audit trails are maintained for administrative actions.
- Platform features that can be abused are rate-limited and reviewed.
- The app uses a closed-source model so operational safeguards can remain private.

### Public Security Disclosure

PESiMENs follows a privacy-first and security-conscious approach. At a high level, the live product may collect:

- account and profile details needed to operate the app
- community activity created inside the platform
- basic usage and security telemetry needed for reliability and abuse prevention

PESiMENs does not collect institutional academic records such as grades, marksheets, or exam results unless a separate feature or policy says otherwise.

Authentication is handled by the live application and uses protected session flows, while sensitive credentials are never stored in this public repository.

Data should be protected in transit with HTTPS, and sensitive operational secrets should remain encrypted or stored outside the repo in deployment-time environment variables or a secret manager.

Third-party services used by the product may include hosting, authentication, storage, notifications, AI providers, payments, and other managed infrastructure services required to run the app.

Security issues should be reported through the maintainer contact listed above or through the project’s official support channel.

## 🔐 Privacy

- No passwords are committed to this repository.
- No live user data is included.
- No real API keys, tokens, or service credentials are present.
- Example configuration files are only templates.
- Uploaded files, logs, and build outputs should remain outside version control.

If you want to publish a privacy policy, it should explain:

- what user data is collected
- why it is collected
- where it is stored
- how long it is retained
- who can access it
- how users can request deletion or support
